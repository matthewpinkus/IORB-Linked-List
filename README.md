# IORB-Linked-List
Year 2 Semester 1 Systems Programming Assignment 1

Compiling and Running:
	Non executable compiling (main.c, sortList.h):
		Save both main.c and sortList.h to the same directory (desktop works best)
		Through your terminal, access the directory in which the program is saved (cd to desktop)
		To compile, type 'gcc -o main main.c'
		There should now be a file called 'main' in the directory.
		Enter ./main to run, and follow prompts to use the program.
	
	Executable compiling (IORB Linked List.exe):
		Run IORB Linked List.exe
		Allow program through any prompted firewall protections
		Follow prompts to use the program
